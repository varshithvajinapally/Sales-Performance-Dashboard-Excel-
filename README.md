* Interactivity: Filters by Year to analyze time-based performance and seasonal sales variations.

### 3. Profit by Segment & Year:

* Functionality: Pie chart visualizes profit contribution by customer segments (e.g., Consumer, Corporate).
* Interactivity: Includes slicers for filtering by Segment and Year, enabling quick comparisons across segments and time.

### 4. Top 10 Customers by Sales:

   * Supports decision-making by allowing business users to view customized perspectives based on selected filters.

## Conclusion:

The Sales Performance Dashboard offers a streamlined and interactive way to visualize key sales metrics from the Superstore dataset. It serves as a vital tool for business teams to track regional sales performance, monitor trends, and identify profitable customer segments. Built entirely in Excel, this dashboard ensures accessibility and ease of use without requiring any external software or coding knowledge.
